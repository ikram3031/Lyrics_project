        <p class="in">In Flames is a Swedish heavy metal band, formed by guitarist 
            Jesper Str√∂mblad in Gothenburg in 1990. Alongside At the Gates and Dark 
            Tranquillity, In Flames pioneered the genres known as Swedish death metal 
            and melodic death metal.</p>
        <p class="in"> During the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of 
            musicians recording with them, including many session musicians. By the release of 
            Colony (1999) the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album 
            Reroute to Remain (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that 
            moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal. This 
            decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it 
            increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, 
            In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide.</p>
        <p class="in"> Since the band's inception, In Flames have released thirteen studio 
            albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs, their latest release being their thirteenth
             studio album I, the Mask in 2019. In Flames has been nominated for three Grammis 
             Awards. They won two of these nominations; one for Soundtrack to Your Escape (2004) 
             in the "Hard Rock/Metal of the Year" category, and one nomination for their
              following album Come Clarity (2006) in the same category. </p>
